          was an Iranian politician who served as the last Prime Minister of
          Iran under the Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. In the words of historian
          Abbas Milani: "more than once in the tone of a jeremiad he reminded
          the nation of the dangers of clerical despotism, and of how the
          fascism of the mullahs would be darker than any military junta".He and
          his secretary were murdered in his home in Suresnes, near Paris by
          agents of the Islamic Republic.
